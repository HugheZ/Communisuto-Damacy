## The Game

Communisuto Damacy is the sequel to Grover Man. In this game, the Communists have formed a plan to defeat the Capitalists by using a secret weapon, the glorious ball of stuff. You play as this ball in your first mission: disruption of a Pentagon office. In order to protect your nation, you will have to grow large enough to make your creators see your use, which will lead to the development of a greater weapon. 

Gameplay is timed, and nearly everything in the given scene is pickup-able. The mice will ignore you at first, but they will run when you are large enough to threaten them. 

This program is more of a tech demo than a balanced game, but it may provide a few moments of fun. Voice credit goes to my partner, listed on the main splash screen. Irregular shapes will change your ball's collision detection (originally through the bounding shell algorithm but now implemented through Unity's child collider framework).
